# Linear Regression

**1.when A and B are similar, are A and B have the same eigenvalue?** 

similar matrix of A means that $$B=T^{-1}AT$$ , then $$B\vec v=T^{-1}AT\vec v=>TB\vec v=AT\vec v =>T(\lambda\vec v)=\lambda(T\vec v)=A(T\vec v)$$, then A and B have the same eigenvalue 

**2. Regarding singular values of matrices, the following statements are corrected?**

* [ ] The singular value only exists in the squared matrix
* [ ] The singular value may be positive or negative
* [x] The number of non-zero singular values is related to the rank of the matrix

**3. Sum of two invertible matrice are invertible or not? what about the product of two invertible matrice?** 

Sum of two invertible matrice may not invertible. For example A+\(-A\) = 0; product of 2 invertible matrice are invertible.
